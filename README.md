# Bootcamp_project
Bootcamp final project

Base of this project is to create historic version of calendar
which includes the most important events from Poland history in
a thousand years from now. 

Selected events are those who always stay in our memories: battles, unions, 
and another dates which made strong influence on our consciousness. 
Achievements of our ancestors had huge impact on our lives and our 
reality.

Calendar is made in React JS.
